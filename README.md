**Note: This is work in progress to transfer the SD-JWT implementation from ttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/ into this repository. Until this is done, please refer to the original repository.**

# SD-JWT Reference Implementation

This is a reference implementation of the [IETF SD-JWT specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/). It is written in Python.

This implementation is used to generate the examples in the specification, but can also be used as a library in other projects.
